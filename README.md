ABSTRACT:

    4-bit password security system (using NOR & XOR gates)
    The project is a security system which allows only authorized access to users
    with a password. This system provides a user friendly security system for
    organizations and homes.
    
    The idea of this system is that the 4 switches "KEY CODE SWITCHES" acts as
    holding the correct password for unlocking the lock. On the other hand the
    other 4 switches "DATA ENTRY SWITCHES acts as data entry point where the
    code is to be entered to open lock. The "KEY CODE SWITCHES" have static
    value and is hidden from the person who is trying to open the lock. If the
    "DATA ENTRY CODE matches the "KEY CODE" then the green LED will light up
    and the lock will open. While if the "DATA ENTRY CODE" does not match the
    "KEY CODE" then the red LED will glow which is an alarming situation that
    some wrong person is unlocking the lock.
    
    The project offers valuable hands-on experience in digital logic design,
    providing a practical understanding of how digital circuits can be used
    to create secure systems. Students gain skills in circuit design,
    implementation, and debugging, reinforcing theoretical knowledge
    with practical application.
